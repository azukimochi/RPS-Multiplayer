# Pokemon Rock Paper Scissors

This is an experimental prototype RPG game based on Pokemon.   You do not need knowledge of Pokemon to win this game.  

This game was created using JavaScript, CSS, jQuery, and HTML, and Firebase.  Bootstrap was not used for creating this game, but it has been made responsive (see responsive.css).  

The creator of this game is azukimochi and she can be contacted via https://github.com/azukimochi.

### HOW TO PLAY:

1. Enter your name to become Player 1 or Player 2.  You will have then entered the Pokemon stadium.  You will be playing in real-time with another player. 
2. Player 1 has the first turn and will either choose a rock pokemon, a wood (paper) pokemon, or a scissor-like pokemon.  These pokemon represent rock, paper, and scissors respectively.  Player 2 will not be able to see their selection.  
3. It's then Player 2's turn and they'll choose a rock, wood (paper), or scissor-like pokemon.  
4. Both pokemon will appear on each user's screen and the score will be calculated.  Wins and losses will show up on the screen. 
5. It is then Player 1's turn and the game cycles through the same way again.
6.  You can chat with the user in the chat box.  If the user disconnects, a warning message will appear in the chat box. 

**Note: In this game, just like with real Pokemon logic, you cannot choose the same pokemon twice in a row.  They'd be too tired and drained of HP anyway! After missing one turn, the pokemon is ready for use again!**
